Object Oriented Programming
- Managing complexity by modeling objects
- Support reuse of software components
- Couples data with the tasks that manipulate data

4 pillars of of OOP
1. Abstraction-Creation of all well defined interfaces
2. Encapsulation-keeping the implementation details of your private(hidden) data
3. Hierarchy-resue of abstractions, compositions and derivation
4. Polymorphism-The same code works transparently on instances of different types

Inclusion Guard: Helps in making sure that class declaration is not used multiple 
times
